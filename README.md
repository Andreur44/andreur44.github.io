# Anniversary Project 🎉

Welcome to the **Anniversary Project**! This project is a non-profit initiative created to celebrate a special birthday. The website was developed as a fun and engaging way to make the day memorable for the birthday celebrant.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a quiz game where participants are challenged to guess the names of songs based solely on their lyrics. No audio is used in the game; instead, participants must rely entirely on their knowledge of the song lyrics to make their guesses.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

We want to emphasize that this project is for entertainment purposes only and was created with the intention of avoiding any issues with the original authors and copyright holders. We have taken care to ensure that the lyrics are used in a respectful manner and do not infringe upon any rights. If you are an author or copyright holder and have any concerns, please reach out to us immediately.

## 💻 Features

- **Guess the Song**: A fun and interactive quiz where you guess the names of songs based on lyrics.
- **No Audio Used**: The quiz only involves text (song lyrics) and does not use any music or audio.
- **Non-Profit**: This project was created without any commercial intent. It’s a gift, from us to the celebrant.

## ⏰ Lifespan

Please note that this website is temporary. Once the birthday has passed, the site will be taken down. This project was built for a specific date and purpose, and it will not be maintained or kept online after the celebration.
